        <h2 class="reveal active">Daily Life</h2>
        <p class="reveal active">A typical day for the Badjao centers on the sea. Early in the morning, families prepare their boats and fishing gear while children help with simple tasks. Men often spend the day fishing, diving, or gathering resources, while women sort the catch, weave mats, or manage household work. Evenings are spent repairing nets, cooking fresh seafood, and sharing stories within the community. Their daily rhythm follows the tides, weather, and the constant movement of life on the water.</p>

        <h2 class="reveal active">Lepa Boats</h2>
        <p class="reveal active">Lepa boats are traditional Badjao houseboats made from lightweight local wood shaped into a long, narrow hull for easy travel in shallow coastal waters. Their curved ends help cut through waves, while the flat middle section provides stable space for cooking, sleeping, and storing supplies. Roofs made from woven palm or nipa are added for shade but stay light for easy movement. Their design reflects generations of seafaring skills, built specifically for living and traveling on the sea.</p>

        <h2 class="reveal active">Stilt Houses</h2>
        <p class="reveal active">Badjao stilt houses are built above shallow coastal waters, supported by strong wooden posts to stay safe from tides and waves. Made from local timber, bamboo, and nipa, these homes are lightweight yet sturdy, with raised floors for ventilation and protection. Walkways connect the houses, forming tight-knit communities over the water. Their design reflects a lifestyle centered on the sea while providing a stable base near fishing grounds.</p>

        <h2 class="reveal active">Livelihood</h2>
        <p class="reveal active">The Badjao rely on the sea for survival, earning a living through fishing, diving, and gathering marine resources. Many are skilled free divers who collect sea cucumbers, shells, and fish to sell or trade. Others build and repair boats, weave mats, or craft wooden items for income. In coastal towns, some Badjao also work in markets, transport services, or small trades, adapting their skills to both sea and shore.</p>

        <h2 class="reveal active">Beliefs</h2>
        <p class="reveal active">Traditionally, the Badjao believed in sea and nature spirits, seeing the ocean and its creatures as powerful forces that guided their lives. They performed rituals to ensure safe journeys and abundant catches. Over time, as Islam spread through their communities, many Badjao adopted the faith while still honoring aspects of their ancestral practices. Today, their beliefs blend Islamic teachings with a continued reverence for the sea and the spiritual traditions passed down through generations.</p>

        <h2 class="reveal active">Clothing</h2>
        <p class="reveal active">Traditionally, Badjao women wear colorful blouses and skirts often adorned with simple embroidery or beadwork, while men wear loose shirts and trousers with decorative stitching. Both women and men sometimes accessorize with beads or ornaments for special occasions. Today, many Badjao also wear modern clothing, but traditional garments are still worn during ceremonies and cultural events, reflecting their heritage and maritime lifestyle.</p>
